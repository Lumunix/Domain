Domain has support for multiple authors, Authors profiles are at the bottom of every post and can be set by specifying the name of the author in the frontmatter of a post. Contents of the author profile are set in the [_config.yml](https://github.com/Lumunix/Domain/blob/main/_config.yml) file.

{% include CodeHeader.html %}
```markdown

author: lumunix

```

This is the configuration for the author profile at the bottom of this page.
{% include CodeHeader.html %}
```markdown
authors:
