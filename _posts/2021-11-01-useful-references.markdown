[[Docker::https://www.docker.com/get-started]] is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.


[[Jekyll::https://jekyllrb.com/docs/]] is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

[[Lunr::https://lunrjs.com]] is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. It indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for retrieving documents that best match text queries.

[[Katex::https://katex.org]] is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation in web browsers.

[[FontAwesome::https://fontawesome.com]] is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less.

[[Google Analytics::https://analytics.google.com]] is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.

[[MathJax::https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax]] is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers. It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems. It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily. Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.
