Hello, you can call me Lumunix.

I'm a professional software engineer that specializes in automation and distributed cloud applications.

I'm into technology, cars, software, extreme sports, science fiction, gaming and I'm a member of the LGBTQIA+ and Furry community.

By day I work as a software automation specialist, a fancy way of saying I wear many hats all in the effort of "How can we make software better, faster and cheaper?". On any given day I'm developing automated CI/CD, leading new software development best practices and business processes efforts, or developing deployment and testing infrastructure in efforts to leave things in a better state than they were at the start of the day.

By night I like to work on a variety of personal projects, from experimenting with new technologies or concepts to developing websites for charitable causes and conventions. Im always learning or experimenting.
